        <h1>Shipping</h1>

        <p>Bloomspace delivers to whole of Peninsular Malaysia for most of our plants, while a limited selection is only
            available for KL & nearby areas due to the size.</p>

        <p>Most orders will be ready to ship within 1-3 business days. Tracked parcel option by courier is the default
            shipping method whereby you will receive tracking details by email once the parcel leaves our site. For
            shipping address within Klang Valley, local delivery option by dispatch is also available for your
            convenience, we will try our best to meet your delivery date preference. Lastly, self pickup option is also
            available for collection from our warehouse, you will be contacted once your order is ready for pickup.</p>

        <p>We use 100% recyclable material in our packaging, specially designed to contain any loose soil and hold your
            plants in place during transit. However, due to the handling and transit via courier over long distances, a
            minimal amount of soil may come loose and should be regarded as normal.</p>

        <p>Due to the extensive coverage area, there may be remote locations without proper road access which will be
            impossible for courier delivery, if your intended shipping address is not a major city, please contact us
            with your post code to confirm prior to placing your order.</p>

        <p>It is your full responsibility to ensure that the shipping address and contact number provided is accurate
            and be available to receive the parcel at the first instance to avoid your plants being kept in the courier
            warehouse for an extensive period of time. We will not be liable in the event of any delays caused by
            courier companies.</p>
