        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <div class="information">
            <p>Stemming from our love for plants and nature, we've embarked on this journey since 2017. With a simple
                aim to bring nature closer to our living spaces, we've dedicated much of our waking hours working,
                thinking, and living with plants.
            </p>

            <div>
                <p>From our beloved homegrown brand name, Dóro, we've delivered over a thousand plant gifts (and still
                    counting) to first time plant owners and full time home growers alike, surprising and delighting our
                    customers with the most natural gifts - plants.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Putting our passion and know-how together, we've built Bloomspace.co to serve all Malaysians who
                    wish to
                    own a plant, by making it seamless from order to delivery, all at an affordable price.

                <p>
                    As each of our plants are carefully selected, potted and hand packed in our innovative packaging, we
                    are
                    certain that our plants will reach you in its best condition, so you may effortlessly put these
                    beauties
                    on display. We are even going one step further by offering a 14-days-guarantee for all plants
                    purchased
                    from us.

                    our local community and environment. We're dedicated to a sustainable environment, this means a
                    responsibility to leave the earth better than we found it—one plant at a time. </p>
                <br>
