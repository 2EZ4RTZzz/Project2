        <h1>Return Policy</h1>

        <p>Amme currently do not accept refund request or returns on plants once the order is placed, but we do
            guarantee every plant will arrive in great condition, and all plants are guaranteed for 14 days after
            purchase.</p>

        <p>All plants are carefully packed in a sturdy box for delivery ensuring it arrives in its best form as how they
            left us. As the soil in the pot are loose, a minimal amount may fall into the box which should be considered
            normal.</p>

        <p>If your plant or pot arrived damaged, or your purchase was made less than 14 days ago, please contact us at
            hello@Amme.co to inform us, with your order number and proof of your damaged plant by photo, we will arrange
            a replacement at the next available delivery date upon verification.</p>

        <p>To be eligible for the guarantee, you must ensure collection of your parcel is made within 24 hours if the
            first delivery attempt by our courier partner is not successful and the parcel is returned to their
            warehouse. Please note that repotting your plant into a new container within the first 14 days will void the
            guarantee. Limited to one replacement only for each purchase.</p>

        <p>If you do not receive your item or tracking notification after 14 days of placing the order, please contact
            us at hello@Amme.co, our team will look into the matter and revert to you soonest. Subject to the
            non-availability of an item, Amme reserve the rights to cancel the order and shall provide a refund to you.
